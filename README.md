##  Why a new Theme? 
I like to keep things simple. So I decided to make a beamer theme which focuses on just three things:
1. Color Scheme
2. Font
3. Content

First two are covered by style files and content depends on you. I tried to keep it as simple as possible. With a simple theme and cool tools we can make awesome presentations. Go through the `sample.pdf` to get a better idea of what I am saying.  
## Styles
There are three styles available:
1. light (default) - a light gradient background
2. dark - a dark gradient background
3. none - pure white background

You can check `sample_light.pdf`, `sample_dark.pdf` and `sample_none.pdf` in this repository.

## Tools
Check any of the sample pdf to learn more about tools. You could do many things using these tools:
1. Image in a circle
2. Image with dropshadow 
3. Make cards to present ideas
4. Make fancy tables
5. Make title with cover picture
6. Create boxes across the page
7. Create fancy lists
8. Colorful side headings

## Font
I use `Futura` (sans) and `Monaco` (mono) but if you don't have those (or don't like) then feel free to change them in `beamerinnerthemesimple.sty` file. 

## Can I change it to suit my needs?
Ofcourse you can. My preference may not be exactly same as yours. Play around, make changes or suggest changes - Everything is welcome.
