##  Why a new Theme? 
I like to keep things simple. So I decided to make a beamer theme which focuses on just three things:
1. Color Scheme
2. Font
3. Content

First two are covered by style files and content depends on you. I tried to keep it as simple as possible.    
## Styles
There are two styles available:
1. light (default)
2. dark

You can check `sample_light.pdf` and `sample_dark.pdf` in this repository.

## Font
I use `Futura` (sans) and `Monaco` (mono) but if you don't have those (or don't like) then feel free to change them in `beamerinnerthemesimple.sty` file. 

## Can I change it to suit my needs?
Ofcourse you can. My preference may not be exactly same as yours. Play around, make changes or suggest changes - Everything is welcome.
